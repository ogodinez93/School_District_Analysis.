# School District Analysis

## Overview of Project
School district analysis on student's funding and standardized testing with the following task to complete.

1. Top 5 and base 5 performing schools, in light of the general passing rate. 

2. The normal mathematical score got by understudies in each evaluation level at each school. 

3. The normal perusing score got by understudies in each evaluation level at each school. 

4. School execution dependent on the financial plan per understudy. 

5. School execution dependent on the school size. 

6. School execution dependent on the kind of school

## Resources
- Data Sources: schools_complete.csv and students_complete.csv
- Software: Python 3.7 and Jupyter Notebook

## Results
* The region rundown is influenced by: The normal mathematical score has been changed. The level of math, perusing and generally speaking scores are changed also. 

* The school rundown is influenced by: The level of generally passing has changed for every one of three classifications. 

* How does supplanting the ninth graders' math and perusing scores influence Thomas High School's presentation comparative with different schools? Thomas High School is still on the best five superior. 

* Replacing the ninth graders' math and perusing scores didn't influence the accompanying: 

- Math and perusing scores by grade 

- Scores by school spending 

- Scores by school size 

- Scores by school type
  

  
## Summary
The following four major changes in the updated school district analysis after reading and math scores for the ninth grade at Thomas High School have been replaced with Nans are:
* The average math score has changed from 79.0 to 78.9
* The percentage of passing math has changed from 75 to 74.8
* The percentage of passing reading has changed from 86 to 85.7
* The percentage of overall passing has changed from 65 to 64.9
